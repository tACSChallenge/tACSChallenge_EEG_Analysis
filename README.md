The Matla scripts in this folder do two things:

1. Those scripts with IAF in their name analyse the resting EEG data and extract the IAF (Individual Alpha Frequency, or Peak Alpha Frequency) from the data according to the procedure described in the registerd report. You will need to install this toolbox for it to work --> https://github.com/corcorana/restingIAF
2. 3. The function 'BIDSify' converts your data into BIDS format which you should do before uploading it on OSF.

All scripts were written by Yifan Shen and Simon Hanslmayr (University of Glasogw, School of Psychology and Neuroscience)
